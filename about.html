            <h2>Major Project Components</h2>
            <p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><b>User Interface</b></dt>
                    <dd>A GUI allows a User to interact with the application with mouse and keyboard.<br />
                        A User can log in to an existing account; create a new account; and browse products, add them to a cart, and check out.</dd>

                    <dt><b>Product Catalogue</b></dt>
                    <dd>A <em>Catalogue Interface</em> serves as a basis for the three Catalogues in the system.<br />
                        The first is a "Catalogue" for storing product data, the second a "Database" for storing User information, <br />
                            and the third an "Order Database" for storing records of all completed orders.<br />
                        The Catalogues are implemented as <em>Singleton Patterns</em> and instantiated before the application runs.</dd>

                    <dt><b>Logging</b></dt>
                    <dd>A LogWriter class records user actions and logs errors. It is implemented as a <em>Singleton Pattern</em>.<br />
                        The LogWriter is instantiated in a static block before the application runs.</dd>

                    <dt><b>User Authentication</b></dt>
                    <dd>A User can enter a username and password into the GUI and the application will search for a matching account in the User Database.<br />
                        Adhearing to best practices, the plaintext password is never saved to disk. Only a record of the hashed password is kept.</dd>

                    <dt><b>Payment Processing</b></dt>
                    <dd>Payment processing is simulated by a PaymentProcessor class. It makes simple validation checks for some given information and returns <em>true</em> if the information passes the checks.<br />
                        It is possible for a credit card to "fail" validation, in which case the order is cancelled.<br />
                        It is purely a simulation and is not secure nor is it intended to truely represent actual credit card validation.</dd>

                    <dt><b>Order Processing</b></dt>
                    <dd>Once a User's credit card passes validation checks, a new Order is created and added to the Order Database.<br />
                        The User is given an order number as confirmation.</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>How to run</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Run CompileProject.bat</li>
                    <li>Program will run and show GUI</li>
                </ol>      
                The program will not allow items to be added to the cart if a user is not logged in.<br />
                Either log in to an existing account with a username and password or create a new account.<br />
                Once an account has logged in, a message "Welcome <USERNAME>!" will appear on the panel and items can be added to the cart.<br />
                Both cart and product catalogue are represented in the GUI as scrollable lists.<br />
                Items can be added to and removed from the cart with the corresponding buttons and the total will automatically update above the cart.<br />
                Checking out will open a new window where the user may enter credit card details - a 16-digit credit card number, an expiration date, and a security code.<br />
                If the credit card passes validation, the order will be complete!<br />
                The user will see a confirmation screen and receive an order number. The order will be added to the Order Database.<br />
                Exiting the application from the File > Exit menu or clicking the "X" in the top right will terminate the application.<br />
                Logged events will output to FinalProjectLog.log
