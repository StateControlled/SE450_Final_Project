############ Program run instructions ############

1. Run CompileProject.bat
2. Program will run and a GUI will appear.

##################################################

The program will not allow items to be added to the cart if a user is not logged in.
Either log in to an existing account with a username and password or create a new account.
Once an account has logged in, a message "Welcome <USERNAME>!" will appear on the panel and items can be added to the cart.
Both cart and product catalogue are represented in the GUI as scrollable lists.
Items can be added to and removed from the cart with the corresponding buttons and the total will automatically update above the cart.
Checking out will open a new window where the user may enter credit card details - a 16-digit credit card number, an expiration date, and a security code.
If the credit card passes validation, the order will be complete!
The user will see a confirmation screen and receive an order number. The order will be added to the Order Database.
Exiting the application from the File > Exit menu or clicking the "X" in the top right will terminate the application.
Logged events will output to FinalProjectLog.log
